  I have done a deployment of the project here:    

            [Gabriel Martins - useverb sample.](http://useverb_gabriel_martins.surge.sh/)
                 

## Stacks used 

    Reactjs, Redux 


## How to use 

It is quite simple you basically have to enter you name on the first page. -  **Please submit a 4+ character name**   

You can change your name in the settings( modal). 

##  Features 

  The dashboard:
    
   – Layout: nav, input area and a sidebar.
        
       Mobile responsiveness
        
        -   The app will be mobile responsive, we have provided an image of what this might look like
            
        -   On small screens the Nav stays where it is.
            
        -   The ‘add todo’ section is directly under the nav, and must always be present
            
        -   The ‘sidebar’ will be pushed under the ‘add-todo’ and the user will be
            
            able to scroll through their todos if there’s too many to fit on the screen
            
      – Nav menu: has two buttons providing the functions:
        
        -   Logout: clear name and redirect to login.
            
        -   Settings: A modal that allows the user to change their name and theme.
            
       Sidebar:
        
        -   The sidebar shows todos the user has added
            
        -   The selector at the top allows the user to view todos that have been
            
            ‘completed’, or still todo, or all todos.
            
        -   Completed todos should be shown in the order they were completed
            
        -   Todos ‘to-be-completed’ should be shown in reverse order they were
            
            added, (i.e, oldest first, newest last)
            
        -   All todos should be shown in the order they were added (newest first, oldest last)

  Todo:
    
    -   The ‘todo’ items in the side bar will have an obvious way to mark the
        
        todo as ‘completed’.
        
    -   User’s should (somehow) be able to delete/remove todos, but only if
        
        they have been completed
        
    -   ‘completed’ todos will visually look different from ‘non-completed’ todos
        
  Settings Modal: (we have not provided starter code for this)
    
    -   User should be able to change their name and theme.
        
    -   The user should have at least one other theme option to select from.
        
    -   The modal will open in front of the app with a semi-transparent
        
        background (just like any other basic-b modal).

## Time  and learning 

I have spend about 10 hours on the development. However, I have never work with Redux before so I had to play with it for a while (10 hours more I would say). I usually I use Context  to manage my global states as well as props. 

Other fun part was to create a theme without using any hook or lib, that was a other part that I spend some time to find a soluction to integrate it with my css. I have been using ( styled-components lib for a while where you creat your onw components - It was funny to see jsx with divs and inputs .... ).
